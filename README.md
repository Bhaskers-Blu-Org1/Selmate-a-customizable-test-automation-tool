# Selmate-a-customizable-test-automation-tool
Selmate is developed as an extensible and customizable tool to automate regression testing for Web applications. It provides its own scripting language based on spreadsheet/xml and relevant API in Java for external communication. Selenium WebDriver is used internally by Selmate for all browser communication. This is an endeavor to minimize the programming effort required for test automation using Selenium.
